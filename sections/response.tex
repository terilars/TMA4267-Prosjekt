\textit{ Which response variable will provide information about the problem described above?
Are there several response variables of interest?
How should the response be measured?
What can you say about the accuracy of these measurements?}

The response variable chosen is amount of time measured in seconds from the first hit of the nail head until the head is flush with the wood. 

Another response variable that could be taken into consideration is the number of hits used to apply the nail properly into the material. The time is preferred due to importance for the entrepreneur's ability to complete projects at less time, making more profit, needing less manpower and be more predictable for the Builder.

The response should be measured strictly from video recordings of the experiments. By navigating video frames it is possible to note the time stamp on the first hit on the head, and follow the nail's journey down to flush. For each experiment, the video is restarted. Before experiment starts, a paper note shows run number and standard number.

By assuming each video frame is captured roughly 25 times per second, the accuracy is TODO: scifi accuracy.
