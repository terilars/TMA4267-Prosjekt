Checklist for the report: For the DOE project report the following points are important to cover:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item the report must start with the research question you want to ask
    \item you must clearly state what is the response (continuous measurement) and what are the factors (two levels)
    \item any blocking variables present must be explained,
how is the DOE plan constructed (is it 2by3 in two replications, full 2by4, 2by4 in two or more blocks?, fractions?)
    \item the DOE plan and the added response (your data) must be part of the report
    \item randomization must be addressed
    \item genuine run replication must be addressed
    \item is inference based on a full or reduced model? include a Pareto plot with a red line for significance (based on a full or reduced model, not only Lenth)
    \item residual plots and interpretation (and possible BoxCox plot) must part of the report
    \item plots and interpretation (effect size) of main effects and interaction effect must be present
    \item there must be a conclusion to what you have found
\end{enumerate}
