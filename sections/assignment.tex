This research problem is a joint venture, partly financed by a NTNU startup called Red Hot Nails AS. Partly financed by the Norwegian Proverb Council (NPC)\footnote{Both company and council are indeed fictional}.Red Hot Nails AS intend to make a combined nail heater and Grandiosa oven. It is common "bro science"\footnote{Slang for layman's research} that carpenters are fond of their daily supply of Grandiosa pizza. It remains to be proven though, that hot nails apply faster in wood. The problem is to test wether pre-heated nails are faster to apply in wood with a standard hammer. Also, if left handed carpenters will enjoy more benefits from hot nails than right handed of the kind.

For a renowned statistician like this researcher, the problem is rather trivial and of less interest. Still, it is research like this that pays the bills.

The researcher and the experimenter is in this experiment one and the same person. The researcher has broad carpenterial knowledge from mounting IKEA furniture and bird cages. One practical assumption is that the researchers has hammer competence well above population average.

The research founder obviously want to see clear evidence that hot nails are faster to apply.The NPC would like to test the transferability of the Norwegian proverb "like cutting butter with a warm knife".
